<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Raised in a vibrant household by a single mom alongside my older brother, 
  I've always valued the strength and resilience of family. My mother worked
   tirelessly to provide for us, instilling in me a strong work ethic and determination 
   to pursue my dreams. Currently, I am a second-semester student at BMCC, diving into the
    world of computer science.</p>

<p>Math has always fascinated me, even if I don't consider myself a natural at it. 
  I enjoy the challenge it presents and the problem-solving skills it nurtures. Beyond academics, 
  I have a passion for K-pop, savoring the dynamic beats and captivating performances.
   Korean food holds a special place in my heart, reminding me of the warmth of home and family gatherings.</p>

<p>In my free time, I immerse myself in anime and series, exploring different worlds and stories
   that inspire my creativity. As I navigate my educational journey, I look forward to blending 
   my love for technology and culture, aspiring to make a meaningful impact in the field of computer science.</p>
